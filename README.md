Extended version of Arduino Uno enables WiFi and Bluetooth communication thanks to embedded ESP32-S3-Mini module. The UNO R4 WiFi maintains the same form factor, pinout, and 5 V operating voltage as its predecessors, but also has expanded memory, faster clock, extra on-board peripherals, supports a wider input voltage range, provides HID support, support for battery-powered RTC, Qwiic connector and build-in LED matrix. This repository covers main topics and functionalities of this controller, such as: 
* [MQTT client-server architecture](https://github.com/Pyother/ArduinoR4WiFi/tree/master/sketch_mqtt_client)
* I2C communication
* (in progress)
